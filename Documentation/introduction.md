# Documentation

In these folders I will record my findings from the decompiled source of the original Boxhead 2Play game.

I have used the [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler) to achieve this, ticking the "Automatic deobfuscation" setting.

These files will mostly be lists or tables of values, but I expect there will be more interesting things to explore in the navigation and collision detection parts of the game.
